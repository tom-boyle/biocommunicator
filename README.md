**Biocommunicator** is a cutting-edge AI-driven platform focused on enabling communication with nature, specifically plants and animals, through artificial intelligence. Our goal is to create tools that translate interactions between living organisms, bringing humans closer to the natural world.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI Communication Models**: Enable communication with plants and animals through our advanced AI models.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Collect and process data from nature in real time.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface to interact with our AI models.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability in mind for handling large datasets and multiple interactions.

## 📖 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Biocommunicator on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **pip** for managing Python packages

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biocommunicator.git
    cd biocommunicator
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

### Running Tests

Biocommunicator uses Python's built-in `unittest` framework for testing. All test files are stored in the `tests/` directory.

To run the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

You can add new test files to the `tests/` directory following this example:

```python
# tests/test_sample.py

import unittest

class TestSample(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)
    
    def test_subtraction(self):
        self.assertEqual(5 - 3, 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Each test file should follow the naming convention `test_*.py`, and be structured similarly.

## 📚 Documentation

Full documentation for Biocommunicator can be found in the [docs](./docs) folder.

## 🌱 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Model optimization for higher accuracy in nature communication.
- [ ] Implement real-time interaction dashboard.
- [ ] Expand support for more species of plants and animals.
- [ ] Integration with hardware sensors for live data collection.
